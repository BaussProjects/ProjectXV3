This is not the full project of ProjectX V3. It's a minor stripped project.
This project does not use MSSQL for items either, however the other version does.

It should be pretty easy to do. The tables for Inventory & Equipments is already added in the db.

Missing/stripped features:
	Interserver
	Friends/Enemies
	Sobs
	Tournaments (LastManStanding is left in the source as an example.)
	Raids
	Quests
	GuildWars
	
Known bugs:
	If upgrading to an item with higher stats than the character the item will not be removed,
		same if you login with an item that got higher stats than the character. (Relative easy fix.)
